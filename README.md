# Jamie's Toolbox

Contains a random selection of scripts, configuration files and workspace tools that I have in place for the tooling that I use day-to-day.

The aim of this is to keep it up to date and make sure I'm able to quickly set up new devices or environments if required, and to have a centrally-documented repository for my configuration.

## Supported Tooling

- ZSH
- GitHub Settings
